        <h2>Kailash : Where Shiva Lives</h2>

        <p>Sep 2021: After a massive disaster of Covid-19, I think 2021 is a good opportunity for me. After lots of death, lots to lockdowns it is my first time India visiting blog in this year. One of the daily rituals I often find myself doing, especially
            during a pandemic when traveling is off-the-table for the time being, is to visit several of my favourite adventure and backpacking blogs and read up on travel stories, plan my future trips, and lose myself in the world of travel where anything
            is possible. I used to breathe travel before the pandemic hit. In a good year, I would be traveling to over 10 countries, spending at least 2 weeks in each country, and spending months exploring all the interesting things this world has to
            offer. Nowadays, I am bound by the limit of my own country and with the new waves of infection rolling in every few months here in Thailand and the vaccination rollout is slow, I needed to find another way to escape and lose myself in the
            world of travel once again. So, I packed my bag pack and go away for a new adventure ,a new life.. I love India ,specially Indian mountains . Nowadays, they continue to provide us with new travel guides as well as sharing their incredible
            journey on how they have created such a successful travel blog which is extremely valuable for those who are looking to start their own adventure and backpacking blog. What ever, This is all good for beginners but when these blogs grow, most
            bloggers forgot about design and instead doubled down on SEO and marketing, sometimes sacrificing user experience for profit. Their identities are diluted over time and hence why most of the travel blogs you see nowadays feel similar to one
            another. What I love about it: The Travel Episodes does not just take storytelling to the next level with their writings but also with video clips, sound effects, and photography. It's like reading a futuristic storybook that teleported you
            to the place.
