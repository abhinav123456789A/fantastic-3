        <p>
            Welcome to the first edition of our Current Events Conversation for the 2022-23 school year. If you’re new here, every Thursday, editors at The Learning Network round up some of the best teenage comments posted to our recent writing prompts, both to honour
            students and their schools and to offer a snapshot of what young people are thinking about issues in the news. To kick off the new school year, we asked students “What Were Your ‘Mundane Joys’ of Summer?” inspired by Jessica Grose’s Parenting
            newsletter, in which she wrote about the “normal things” her children were looking forward to after two pandemic-disrupted vacations. Teenagers shared the simple pleasures that made this summer so enjoyable: going to camp, getting a job, riding
            in a car with friends, spending time with grandparents, playing on the football team and more. But most of all, they said they were grateful for this summer being “back to normal,” or at least something close to it. Keep reading for more of
            their “mundane joys.” If you are a student and would like to see your comment featured in a future roundup, just post a response to any of our writing prompts, whether our Student Opinion questions or our Picture Prompts, and follow these
            tips: Don’t worry that you have to submit a perfectly polished essay; instead, we want to hear your honest thoughts expressed in your unique voice. Share personal stories related to the prompt that include relevant and compelling details.
            State an opinion that’s supported by strong evidence or reason, either from the article you read or your own experiences. Offer a unique take or perspective on the topic that you don’t see others talking about. Start a conversation with other
            students by hitting the “reply” button. Ask questions, share connections or add onto what they said. Follow The New York Times commenting standards and be thoughtful about how your response might be read by others. Thank you to all the teenagers
            from around the world who got this year off to a strong start — we heard from students from Glenbard West High School in Glen Ellyn, Ill., Atrisco Heritage Academy High School in Albuquerque, Hanover-Horton High School in Horton, Mich., and
            many more places. Some of the mundane joys that I experienced included waking up without an alarm, eating popsicles on the front porch with my brother, and reading whenever I felt like it. What made these simple things so joyful for me was
            knowing that I was choosing to do them, and could choose to stop at any time. I followed my own wants and whims whenever I felt like it. This is very different from the pandemic summers, as my options were incredibly limited by the restrictions,
            and instead of feeling content to be alone, I felt trapped by my lack of choice in the matter, regardless of whether I would have chosen it anyway … what makes summer activities so fun is that they are uninterrupted by life’s responsibilities.
