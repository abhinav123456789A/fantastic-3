        <h2>Camera : Modern era new eye</h2>


        <h3 style="padding-left: 90px; font-size: 30px;">What is the need of camera ?</h3>
        <p>
            A camera, by the most basic of definitions, captures still photographs or video, either on film or digitally. The importance of the camera is not in the device itself, but in what it produces. Photographs and video have become vital to communication,
            education and preservation of history.

            <br>


            <strong>1.) Communication : </strong> <br> A camera helps communicate a story of a person, a place or an event Cliches are cliches because everyone has heard them before. A picture is worth a thousand words. Photos and videos taken with cameras
            are used to communicate, to tell stories. The camera was and is a tool or war, used to capture events or people. It is also a tool of everyday lives--just browse an album on Facebook and you'll have "read" a kind of story.

            <br>

            <strong>2.) Education :</strong> <br> Photographic visuals produced by cameras can enhance the learning process. Some people learn by hearing, others by writing, some by seeing. The camera has added a new dimension to education, allowing photographs
            and video to become learning tools. Imagine a medical school textbook without photographs. Learning takes on a whole new dimension when a student can visualize the medium.
            <br>

            <strong>3.) Preservation :</strong> <br> Cameras capture special events and preserve memories. The camera helps to create and preserve memories of historical and/or sentimental value. Famous photographs of notable moments and events from history
            were made possible by the camera. Every day babies are born, people get married, and all of it is documented with cameras, a source of helping us remember our past. The camera is a valuable source to preserve history.

        <h3 style="padding-left: 90px; font-size: 30px;">What does DSC means in camera?</h3>

        <p>
            Most digital camera pictures are tagged DSC. What do those initials mean? Digital cameras have become part of our daily lives. These cameras come in many models, from cell phones to complex professional equipment. DSC is a common phrase link to digital
            cameras. It's helpful to know what this phrase means.
            <br>
            <strong>D is for Digital :</strong>
            <br> Zeros and ones--discrete numbers--form digital camera images. Unlike film cameras, digital cameras take photographic images using discrete numbers. These are numbers that represent data, using zeros and ones. These numbers are translated
            into color or black and white pixels. We see these discrete numbers as images.
            <br> Thanks to these discrete numbers, digital photographers can see photographs instantly, in preview form.

            <br>

            <strong>S is for Still :</strong>
            <br> Say cheese! The still camera captures another image of everyday life. Still cameras collect a single image--a moment frozen in time. Many modern digital cameras offer both still and video image options. Still camera images remain popular.
            They are easy to transfer from a camera, or cell phone, to a personal computer. They can be quickly shared with friends and family, either as e-mail attachments, postings on social networking sites, or as images on a portable storage device
            such as a flash drive, thumb drive or compact disc.
            <br>
            <strong>C is for Camera :</strong>
            <br> Digital cameras make photography quick and easy. A camera is, by definition, a typically box-shaped item that records visual images, either on film or via discrete numbers. With many digital cameras built into modern cell phones, the
            classic image of the camera has changed. Whether it is a stand-alone device or a cell phone application, the digital still camera is a versatile tool that gives us a record of people, places and events in our lives that we want to remember.
