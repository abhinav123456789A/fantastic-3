        <h3 style="padding-left: 90px; font-size: 30px;">History :</h3>
        <p>
            Throwing the javelin as sport evolved from the everyday use of the spear in hunting and warfare. It was widely practised in Ancient Greece and incorporated into the Olympic Games in 708BC as part of the pentathlon. It has been part of the modern Olympic
            Games programme since 1908 for men and 1932 for women. In 1986 the men's javelin was redesigned; its centre of gravity was moved forward by four centimetres. This shortened throwing distances by approximately 10 per cent by bringing its nose
            down earlier and more steeply. This move was made because the men, following a world record of 104.80m by East Germany's Uwe Hohn in 1984, were in danger of throwing the javelin beyond the space available in normal stadiums. In 1999, the women's
            javelin was similarly redesigned. The Czech athlete Jan Zelezny is regarded as the finest male javelin thrower in history. He won a hat-trick of Olympic titles from 1992-2000 and set the world record of 98.48m in 1996. His compatriot Barbora
            Spotakova is among the leading female javelin throwers in history, she won successive Olympic titles in 2008 and 2012 and is the owner of the women’s world record with a best of 72.28m.

        <h3 style="padding-left: 90px; font-size: 30px;">Javelin throw rules :</h3>
        <p>
            The objective of javelin throw is to hurl a narrow cylindrical hollow spear the furthest distance possible. Throwers must abide by a set of rules for their throws to count as valid. For the throw to be counted, the javelin must land tip first inside the
            bounds of the landing sector. The javelin, however, needs to only make a mark on the ground and doesn't necessarily need to stick in the ground or 'break turf'. The athlete must hold the javelin at the grip with one hand. Wearing gloves on
            the throwing hand is not allowed. Athletes may tape their fingers as long as it doesn’t provide any additional assistance during the throw. Judges check tapings before competitions. Taping two or more fingers together is also not allowed.
            Throughout the entire process of the throw, the javelin must be kept at an overhand position, i.e. over the shoulder or upper part of the throwing arm. Unlike other throwing events, non-orthodox styles are not permitted in javelin throw, which
            means athletes need to conform their techniques to a set of fixed rules. Athletes also cannot turn their backs to the landing sector until the throw is completed. While releasing the javelin and before it lands, athletes must stay behind the
            throwing arc or foul line. Javelin throwers cannot overstep the throwing arc during a throw. Javelin throwers cannot overstep the throwing arc during a throw. Once their turn is announced, athletes also need to complete their throw in under
            a minute. Failure to meet any of the above rules results in a foul throw and the attempt is not counted.
