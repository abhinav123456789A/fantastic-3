        <h3 style="padding-left: 90px; font-size: 30px;">Women's Safety Around the World</h3>
        <p>
            Personal safety is a basic human right that no one should have to live without. Unfortunately, at least 50% of the world’s population faces threats to their personal safety every day. Women of all ages and backgrounds are constantly dealing with unsafe
            situations, whether when walking home alone, riding in taxis, or simply existing in public places. This process proved to be incredibly complex, as we had to rely on official data that may or may not accurately reflect reality. The results
            of our research depended on each country’s level of transparency about the number of crimes against women, as well as women’s ability and willingness to report these crimes in the first place.

        <h3 style="padding-left: 90px; font-size: 30px;">Crime against womens</h3>
        <p>
            First, we’ll explain our research on crimes committed against women across the world. We rated 78 countries based on four different categories:
            <br> 1. Murder of women – The murder rate per 100,000 women between 2010 and 2020, based on officially reported crimes
            <br> 2. Rape – The rape rate per 100,000 women between 2010 and 2019, based on officially reported crimes
            <br> 3. Sexual abuse – The rate of sexual abuse per 100,000 women between 2010 and 2020, based on officially reported crimes (and excluding reports of rape)
            <br> 4. Domestic violence – The average percentage of women (aged 15 and older) who were victims of physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner between 2010 and 2017, based on officially reported crimes

        <h3 style="padding-left: 90px; font-size: 30px;">How to keep yourself safe</h3>
        <p>
            Here are a few tips, techniques, and best practices for staying safe, whether in an unknown environment, a foreign country, your own city, or at home:
            <br> • Always let someone know where you are and where you’re going.
            <br> • Share your live location with a friend when traveling alone or meeting someone new.
            <br> • Learn and practice self-defense tactics from a qualified and recommended trainer.
            <br> • Trust your instincts; if you have a feeling that a situation may be dangerous, try to avoid it. For example, if you don’t feel comfortable walking home at night, ask a friend to walk with you or find another mode of transportation.
            <br> • Learn how to automatically activate emergency notifications on your Apple or Android device.
            <br> • If you feel threatened, don’t stay silent; loudly draw attention to yourself and your assailant.
            <br> • If you’re being abused – physically, emotionally, or psychologically – get help. Speak with a family member or a friend, call a domestic violence hotline, or contact local authorities.
