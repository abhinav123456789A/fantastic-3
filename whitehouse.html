        <h2>United States of America : The super power</h2>


        <h3 style="padding-left: 90px; font-size: 30px;">America's nuclear power</h3>
        <p>
            The United States was the first country to manufacture nuclear weapons and is the only country to have used them in combat, with the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II. Before and during the Cold War, it conducted 1,054 nuclear tests,
            and tested many long-range nuclear weapons delivery systems.[Note 1] Between 1940 and 1996, the U.S. Federal Government spent at least US$10.1 trillion in present-day terms on nuclear weapons, including platforms development (aircraft, rockets
            and facilities), command and control, maintenance, waste management and administrative costs.
            <br> It is estimated that the United States produced more than 70,000 nuclear warheads since 1945, more than all other nuclear weapon states combined.
            <br> Until November 1962, the vast majority of U.S. nuclear tests were above ground. After the acceptance of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, all testing was relegated underground, in order to prevent the dispersion of nuclear fallout.
            <br> By 1998, at least US$759 million had been paid to the Marshall Islanders in compensation for their exposure to U.S. nuclear testing. By March 2021 over US$2.5 billion in compensation had been paid to U.S. citizens exposed to nuclear hazards
            as a result of the U.S. nuclear weapons program.
            <br> In 2019, the U.S. and Russia possessed a comparable number of nuclear warheads; together, these two nations possess more than 90% of the world's nuclear weapons stockpile. As of 2020, the United States had a stockpile of 3,750 active
            and inactive nuclear warheads plus approximately 2,000 warheads retired and awaiting dismantlement. Of the stockpiled warheads, the U.S. stated in its March 2019 New START declaration that 1,365 were deployed on 656 ICBMs, SLBMs, and strategic
            bombers.
